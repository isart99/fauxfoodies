                    <p>The city is now cold. Tacos are warm. Frankly, the only logical decision to warm up the body
                        is to eat tacos, so I headed to my favorite taco place in NYC, Los Tacos Numero Uno to indulge
                        in a little self-care (scene: a cold Thursday afternoon). Most authentic taco shops are pretty
                        fast-paced (eh?). When you arrive, the place (no matter what location you go to) is usually
                        packed,
                        so it's semi-important to know what you’re gonna order before you get to the cashier. Assuming
                        you
                        know what you’re going to get (which frankly you should because the menu isn’t exhaustive), you
                        go up to the cashier, order, pay, and take the taco ticket they give you. Then you take the taco
                        ticket and hand it to them. But, wait, Lucas, who is them?! Great question.</p>

                    <p>I don’t really know what the person is called the “preparer?” Food exporter? Person in charge of
                        the tacos? Regardless, the ticket is given to them and you await your tasty treats. But wait,
                        there is more. Next, and let’s end the debate and call them the taco maestro, because they are
                        basically in charge of a whole crew of people, and the beauty they orchestrate is far better
                        than say the New York Philharmonic (is this even a thing? I feel like old people just drop
                        it in nonchalantly as an answer to “what did you do this weekend”), will ask in a matter of
                        seconds “maiz o harina” (translation: corn or flour, which actually doesn’t make sense cause
                        technically harina is flour but is often used to describe corn flour, so then it’s just corn
                        or corn flour????? But I won’t fault the Spanish language). Once you make your choice, and
                        really there is only one, unless you lack taste buds, the taco maestro will ask “con todo?”
                        which obviously the answer is yes, because if the taco maestro offers, you accept.</p>

                    <p>The experience is fast paced, it's also filled with people who speak Spanish (which makes me
                        feel at home), feels lively, and in an odd way the vibes (yes I know I am lame for using this
                        word) is happy. This is probably because I am Mexican, so whenever I consume Mexican food I am
                        reminded of my family, the love I have for them and the love I have for my community. Food
                        constructs memories, identities, and so much more. Taco power.</p>

                    <p>Your job is now done, you can relax, if only for a moment. But it usually only takes maybe a
                        minute or two for your food to finish which at that point you then have to find a place to eat.
                        Here is the interesting part. At most of the Los Tacos spots, the places to eat are standing
                        only, not sitting. But at Chelsea Market there are outdoor seating areas (from COVID or because,
                        frankly, IDK because who takes that long to eat the spicy, hot, delicious goodness of a taco?).
                        So, you stand and even if you are with other people, you take a moment, or moments of silence
                        to eat. Dare I say it's almost a religious experience?</p>

                    <p>I usually have, and I did this time, two tacos de carne asada and one quesadilla de adobada
                        (which I think is just al pastor?). LITERAL drugs. I obviously haven’t tried drugs (what are
                        drugs?), but I imagine if I did, the experience would be comparable. However, I digress.
                        Habanero
                        salsa, a slice of pineapple to cut the heat, the fat from the pork in a salsa with the acid
                        from the lime mixing (see what I did there, not saying I’m a good writer but….), ugh literally
                        so good (I am salivating...gross). If you’ve seen the movie <em>Ratatouille</em> it’s basically
                        like
                        the scene where the Lil guy eats some cheese and strawberries and has a mental explosion
                        cause the flavor is insane. Yes, you are the rat and the strawberries and cheese are the tacos.
                    </p>

                    <p>BOOM, the experience is over, you have enjoyed your tacos/quesadillas/tostadas. You can now
                        die happy, a belly full of delicious food. If you have not been, I would suggest going
                        (they are vegetarian friendly too!). If you think there is a better taco place, I kindly
                        ask you to fight me.</p>

                <p>Before you order some, a word of advice from our favorite Mexican faux-foodie, <a class="names"
                        href="aboutCS.html" target="_blank">Isabel Ríos</a>:</p>

                <div id="textbox3">
                    <h6>How to properly eat your tacos… </h6>
                    <p>Prepare to amaze all your Mexican friends by eating a taco so perfectly, they’ll book you a
                        ticket straight to Mexico City. Order your tacos with the perfect, infalible formula:
                        “(number of tacos) of (type of taco, no need to say the word taco) <em>con todo, por
                            favor</em>”.
                        Only say <em>con todo</em> if you want your taco with everything on it, which usually means
                        onion,
                        coriander, and salsa. The classic taco with everything is the pastor taco, which includes onion,
                        coriander, pineapple, and salsa. The following steps are crucial to maximize your taco-eating
                        experience. Hold the taco by its center of gravity (this shifts the more you eat it), and keep
                        it horizontal (parallel to the ground). Tilt your head about 45º to consume it. Once you receive
                        your delicious tacos, take a moment to remember your training. This is important! You may
                        be tempted to keep your head neutral like a <em>gringo</em>, but this is a rookie mistake.</p>
                    <p><em>Listo</em>, now you can claim your Mexican passport at your nearest embassy.
